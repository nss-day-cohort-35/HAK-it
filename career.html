            <h1>Intro of Lady Gaga's Music Career</h1>
            <p>"In 2007 she and performance artist Lady Starlight formed a revue called the Ultimate Pop Burlesque
                Rockshow.
                That same year Lady Gaga, who also wrote songs for other pop artists such as Fergie, the Pussycat Dolls,
                and
                Britney Spears, was signed by the singer Akon and Interscope Records and began preparing her debut
                album,
                The Fame, which was released in 2008.Although she modeled herself on such theatrical performers as David
                Bowie during his Ziggy Stardust period, the New York Dolls, Grace Slick, and Freddie Mercury—her adopted
                stage name was derived from Queen’s song “Radio Ga Ga”—she created a character that came to occupy a
                unique
                space in the music world. Her fashion combined with her up-tempo, synthetic dance music and her edgy,
                theatrical performance to create stunning sounds and visuals. Indeed, while producing music, Lady Gaga
                also
                created her own sexually charged fashions—replete with dazzling wigs and space-age bodysuits—through her
                creative team Haus of Gaga."
            </p>
            <p>"Her first single, “Just Dance,” became popular in clubs throughout the United States and Europe and
                eventually landed at number one on the Billboard Pop Songs chart (also called the radio chart). Three
                other
                singles off The Fame—“Poker Face,” “LoveGame,” and “Paparazzi”—also reached number one on the radio
                chart,
                making Lady Gaga the first artist in the 17-year history of that chart to have four number ones from a
                debut
                album. The Fame was well received critically and proved enormously successful commercially, selling more
                than eight million copies worldwide by the end of 2009. The album also yielded Lady Gaga five Grammy
                nominations, including for album of the year and song of the year (“Poker Face”); she captured two
                Grammys—best dance recording (“Poker Face”) and best electronic/dance album (The Fame)—and her opening
                duet
                with Sir Elton John was among the most talked-about elements of the 2010 Grammys telecast. In February
                2010
                she also picked up three Brit Awards (the British equivalent of the Grammys)—for best international
                female,
                best album, and breakthrough act.Her second album, The Fame Monster, was released in November 2009 (it
                was
                originally conceived as a bonus disc) and almost instantly produced another hit, “Bad Romance.” Other
                popular singles from the album followed, including “Telephone” (which featured Beyoncé, as did a
                nine-minute
                video produced by Jonas Åkerlund starring the pair and referencing Quentin Tarantino’s film Kill Bill:
                Vol.
                1 [2003]) and “Alejandro.”

                During 2010 Lady Gaga proved to be one of the most commercially successful artists, with a sold-out
                concert
                tour (which had been launched to coincide with the release of The Fame Monster), while she also
                headlined
                Chicago’s Lollapalooza music festival and played in front of a record 20,000 people at NBC’s Today show.
                She
                was named one of Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People and was named by Forbes magazine as one of
                the
                world’s most powerful women, and she capped off 2010 by being named Billboard magazine’s artist of the
                year.
                After arriving at the 2011 Grammy Awards ceremony encased in a giant egg, Lady Gaga went on to claim
                honours
                for best pop vocal album (for The Fame Monster) and best female pop vocal performance and best short
                form
                video (for “Bad Romance”)."</p>
            <p>"Lady Gaga’s third album, Born This Way (2011), found the entertainer reaching back to earlier musical
                eras
                for inspiration. As a blonde dance-pop performer with a penchant for provocation, Lady Gaga had often
                earned
                comparisons to the singer Madonna, and on the album’s first two singles the similarities were especially
                pronounced. The title track was a self-empowerment anthem in the style of Madonna’s 1989 single “Express
                Yourself,” while “Judas” brazenly mixed sexual and religious imagery. Both songs quickly became hits.
                Other
                tracks on the album featured guest appearances from guitarist Brian May of Queen and saxophonist
                Clarence
                Clemons of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band.In 2013 Lady Gaga released Artpop. Although the energetic
                lead
                single “Applause” extended her string of chart successes, the album was perceived as a commercial
                disappointment. She came back the following year with Cheek to Cheek, a collection of standards that she
                recorded with Tony Bennett. The recording topped the Billboard 200 as well as the jazz and traditional
                jazz
                album charts, and it earned the Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album. The relatively understated
                Joanne (2016) performed poorly until Lady Gaga’s halftime Super Bowl performance in February 2017
                brought it
                favourable attention."</p>

            <h2>Acting Career</h2>
            <p>"Lady Gaga made occasional film appearances, notably in Machete Kills (2013) and Sin City: A Dame to Kill
                For
                (2014). She played a vampiric countess with no regard for life or suffering in the fifth season of the
                television show American Horror Story: Hotel (2015–16). For her performance in the anthology series,
                Lady
                Gaga received a Golden Globe Award. She also appeared in the sixth season, which aired in 2016. Lady
                Gaga
                garnered critical acclaim and an Oscar nomination for her first lead role, a guileless up-and-coming
                singer-songwriter in the 2018 remake of the movie A Star Is Born. She cowrote most of that movie’s
                songs,
                many of which she performed with costar and director Bradley Cooper. The lead single, “Shallow,” won two
                Grammy Awards and the Oscar for best original song.Lady Gaga cultivated a devoted following,
                particularly
                among gay men (she acknowledged her own bisexuality), who became some of her most loyal fans. She became
                particularly outspoken on gay rights, especially same-sex marriage, and was a featured speaker at the
                2009
                National Equality March in Washington, D.C." https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lady-Gaga </p>
